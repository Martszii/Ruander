        <p>
          <span>Corvus</span> is a widely distributed genus of birds in the family Corvidae. Ranging in size from the relatively small pigeon-sized jackdaws (Eurasian and Daurian) to the common raven of the Holarctic region and thick-billed raven of the highlands of Ethiopia, the 40 or so members of this genus occur on all temperate continents except South America, and several islands. In Europe, <span>the word "crow"</span> is used to refer to the <span>carrion crow</span> or the <span>hooded crow</span>, while in North America, it is used for the <span>American crow</span> or the <span>northwestern crow</span>.
